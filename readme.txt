Gutenberg-friendly primary category plugin -- the easiest way to choose a category to be used as a part of post's permalink.

== Features ==

* Supports custom post types and custom taxonomies;
* Allows multiple taxonomies in post's permalink.

== Limitations ==

* Works only on hierarchical taxonomies (i.e. does not work on tags);
* No user interface for Classical Editor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `modern-primary-category.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The underlined term that has a red flag by its side is the primary permalink.
2. Verify the structure of your permalinks includes %category% or (any other taxonomy name).
